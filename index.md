BioHackathon Europe is an annual event that brings together life scientists from around the world. It is organised by [ELIXIR Europe](https://elixir-europe.org/), and offers an intense week of hacking, with over 160 participants working on diverse and exciting projects. **The goal is to create code that addresses challenges in bioinformatics research.** 

This year we are holding the BioHackathon at Campus Belloch near Barcelona (see the [Venue page](/venue/)), with remote access available if you cannot attend in person.

Spaces are limited for face-to-face participation and the registration is based on a first-come, first-served basis. **Registration for the 2024 BioHackathon will open in May.**

Maybe just include them (but less intuitive to edit that way).

## Scope
BioHackathon activities are driven by practical sessions where people gather, discuss, and implement ideas during intensive coding sessions. The topics will be aligned to challenges proposed by ELIXIR [Platforms](https://elixir-europe.org/platforms), [Communities](https://elixir-europe.org/communities) and [Focus Groups](https://elixir-europe.org/focus-groups).

## Goals
  * Advance the development of an open source infrastructure for data integration, which will accelerate scientific innovation. We focus on areas that support the work of ELIXIR Platforms, Communities and Focus Groups. These include areas such as FAIR, identifiers, metadata standards, ontologies and metadata catalogues.
  * Engage technical people in the bioinformatics community inside and outside ELIXIR to work together on topics of common interest aligned to ELIXIR activities.
  * Strengthen the interactions with ELIXIR Platforms, Communities and Focus Groups to establish and reinforce collaborations through hands-on programming activities.
