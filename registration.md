## Participant registration

**Registration for BioHackathon Europe 2024 is open but face-to-face (F2F) attendance places are full. You can register either for the  waiting list or virtual participation.** 

Please note that while registration is free, F2F attendees will need to cover their own travel, food and accommodation costs. See the [Venue page](/venue/) for food and accommodation prices.

BioHackathon Europe has limited space for face-to-face participation. The registration is based on a first-come, first-served basis.

## Who can register?
Although the event is organised and funded by [ELIXIR Europe](https://elixir-europe.org), participants from industry and SMEs, and from countries and organisations outside ELIXIR, are welcome to register. 

If you have any queries about this, please contact <biohackathon-europe@elixir-europe.org>.

## Attendance at the venue

All participants are required to stay for the whole duration of the meeting.

## Code of conduct
The Biohackathon will adhere to the [ELIXIR code of Conduct](https://elixir-europe.org/events/code-of-conduct).

## Data protection
The registration form gives you the opportunity to share your contact details with other attendees. If you agree to share your details (name, email, affiliation), these will be kept by the ELIXIR Hub and on EventCase for two months after the event. After this time they will be deleted from both locations. 

If you want the details to be removed earlier, or if you have any queries, please contact us at <biohackathon-europe@elixir-europe.org>.
